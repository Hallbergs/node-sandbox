# Sandbox used to test NodeJS scripts.

The repository contains the necessary boilerplate to enable modules etc. in Node.

## Running scripts

Make sure you have Node (16+) and npm (8+) installed. Then, run `npm install` in the root to install the required dependencies.

The scrips are located in the `scripts`-folder, run with (for example) `node solution.js`.
